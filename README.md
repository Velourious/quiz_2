Display even vowels from user input. Display the vowel that was input most and the number of times it was input.
Professor's comments: “Good job
However you can’t use
const int SIZE = 10000;
char *inputPtr = nullptr;
inputPtr = new char[SIZE];  //pointing to dynamic char array

because this way you are creating a small non-dynamic memory space 
to get around the issue of capturing and dynamically allocating just the EXACT amount of memory"
